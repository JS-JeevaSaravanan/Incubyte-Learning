3 phases - before, going, after

### Before

* Giving is actually hard
* Feedback benefits both, giver and receiver
* Thankful person who is  giving feedback, if not done, things will be worser in future for sure.. or people say behind with others like gossips  


when receiving feedback think in different hats!
Six hats of thinking:
1) Positivity
2) Creativity
3) Emotion
4) Data
5) Downside
6) Process

* have calm and reflective feedback
* don't create  expectation before going to feedback


## During
* Actively Listen - concentrate, take notes , understand
* Responses - provide small responses to know that you are actively listening
* Don't dismiss - don't react, don't freakout, mind facial expresssions
* Be Open - become aware of something you didn't notice
* Ask questions - clarify when necessary
* welcome and embrace unexpected feedback
* show empathy
* Thank them for feedback


## After

- Reflect - keep calm and rethink things happended and background
- Prioritize - plan to improve
- Apply changes
- Look for guidance
- Acceptance Criteria
- Align and manage expectations of your development
- Let people know your situation - if personal issues or something


If no change after feedback (after 3 times) - at some points, must let it know to the hierarchy!

Also include positive feedback always..  - mostly it motivates to other - take more efforts...



feedback - its just about a things, not whole person or not whole item.. 

use sandwidch policy - good thing , need improvement , good thing 




Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key points from the transcript:

1. **Feedback Discussion Recap**:
    
    - A couple of weeks ago, we discussed how to give effective feedback.
    - Focus on **real-time feedback**: Mention what actually happened, how you felt, and the possible consequences.
2. **Avoiding Personalization**:
    
    - Feedback should not be linked to a person's entire personality.
    - It should focus on specific behaviors or actions that need improvement, not the person as a whole.
3. **Bad Feedback Practice: Sandwich Feedback**:
    
    - **Sandwich Feedback**: A practice where you give a positive comment, then mention the area for improvement, and finish with another positive comment.
    - This approach is not recommended because the feedback becomes diluted between the two positive comments and may not be clear.
4. **Effective Feedback Should Be Direct**:
    
    - Keep feedback **focused and to the point**.
    - Address the specific issue that needs improvement, without mixing it with unrelated positive comments.
5. **Example of Giving Feedback**:
    
    - Example of giving feedback: If someone is late for a meeting, it should be addressed directly, not softened or hidden behind positive comments.
6. **Conclusion**:
    
    - The meeting went over by 2 minutes, and the speaker used it as an opportunity to give feedback about being late.
    - Appreciation was given to everyone for their participation and listening.
