RCA = RootCauseAnalysis


not blame someone, sthe someone comeyourself and make surity that it don't repeat.. 

2 times & 3 times => can be digestable at most.. 


minimize the leaks, learn by mistake.. XP cycle.. 
get feedback , use feedback.. 


how to improve our way of testing and code flow.. 

most have bugs should be present in logs.. 




when issue found , the founder person will schedule RCA call and make things well, by being proacting , and taking ownership.. 





while resolving too,.. first write the test case to cause the bug and then fix it.. 


dirve bug - not by assumption, but by proof..
