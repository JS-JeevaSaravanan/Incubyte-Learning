Great question — it’s subtle but important! Here's the breakdown:

---

## 🌐 `global` vs `globalThis`

|Feature|`global`|`globalThis`|
|---|---|---|
|✅ Exists in|Node.js only|All environments (Node.js, browser, etc.)|
|❌ In browsers?|❌ No (will throw error)|✅ Yes (equivalent to `window`)|
|🌍 Universally safe?|❌ No|✅ Yes|
|🔄 Standard?|❌ No (Node-specific)|✅ Yes (added in ES2020)|

---

### 💡 What is `globalThis`?

`globalThis` is the **official, standardized way** to access the global object no matter what environment you're running in — Node.js, browsers, workers, etc.

- In browsers: `globalThis === window`
    
- In Node.js: `globalThis === global`
    
- In Web Workers: `globalThis === self`

### 💣 Why avoid `global`?

If you write:

```js
global.setTimeout(() => {}, 1000);
```

That works fine in **Node**, but will throw `ReferenceError: global is not defined` in the **browser**.

So, using `globalThis` is the cross-platform safe version:

```js
globalThis.setTimeout(() => {}, 1000); // ✅ works everywhere
```

---

### ✅ TL;DR

- Use `globalThis` for **modern, portable, cross-platform** code.
    
- `global` is fine if you're only targeting **Node.js** — but it's not future-proof or browser-safe.
