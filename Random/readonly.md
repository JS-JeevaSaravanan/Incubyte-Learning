### **What does `readonly` help with?**

Adding `readonly` to properties in your DTO **prevents accidental modification** after object creation.

### **Key Benefits of `readonly` in DTOs:**

✅ **Ensures Immutability** – Once the DTO is instantiated, its properties cannot be changed.  
✅ **Improves Code Safety** – Prevents unintended modifications inside the class or elsewhere.  
✅ **Enhances Type Safety** – TypeScript will raise an error if someone tries to modify a `readonly` property.  
✅ **Better Maintainability** – DTOs should be **data carriers**, not mutable objects.

---

### **Example Without `readonly` (Risky)**

```typescript
const response = new ProviderLocationMappingResponseDto(result);
response.metadata.totalRecords = 500; // ❌ Unintended modification allowed
response.mappings = []; // ❌ Can be reassigned, breaking the response structure
```

---

### **Example With `readonly` (Safe)**

```typescript
const response = new ProviderLocationMappingResponseDto(result);
response.metadata.totalRecords = 500; // ❌ Compilation error: Cannot assign to 'totalRecords' because it is a read-only property
response.mappings = []; // ❌ Compilation error: Cannot assign to 'mappings' because it is a read-only property
```

Now, once the DTO is created, its properties **cannot be modified**, ensuring data integrity.

### **When should you use `readonly`?**

- ✅ When properties should never be changed after object creation (like DTOs).
    
- ✅ When defining constant values inside classes.
    
- ❌ Avoid using it if you expect properties to be updated after initialization.
    

Since DTOs are primarily for **data transfer** and should remain immutable, using `readonly` makes them more **robust and safe**. 🚀
