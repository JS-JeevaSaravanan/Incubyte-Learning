While "URI" and "URL" are often used interchangeably, there's a subtle but important distinction between them:1

**URI (Uniform Resource Identifier):**

- **Definition:** A URI is a string of characters that identifies a resource.2 It's a general concept.
- **Purpose:** To provide a way to name and locate resources.3
- **Examples:**
    - `https://www.example.com/page` (URL)
    - `mailto:user@example.com` (URL)
    - `urn:isbn:0-486-27557-4` (URN)

**URL (Uniform Resource Locator):**

- **Definition:** A URL is a specific type of URI that not only identifies a resource but also provides information about how to locate it.4
- **Purpose:** To provide the address of a resource on the internet.5
- **Characteristics:**
    - It typically includes a protocol (e.g., `http`, `https`, `ftp`).
    - It specifies the location of the resource.6
- **Examples:**
    - `https://www.example.com/page`
    - `ftp://ftp.example.com/file.zip`

**Key Differences Summarized:**

- **Scope:** A URL is a subset of a URI.7 All URLs are URIs, but not all URIs are URLs.
- **Function:**
    - A URI identifies a resource.8
    - A URL identifies a resource _and_ tells you how to find it.9

**In simpler terms:**

- Think of a URI as a name or ID.
- Think of a URL as an address.

**Practical Usage:**

- In most web development contexts, you'll encounter URLs more frequently.
- The term "URI" is often used in more technical specifications and documentation.

Therefore, when you are talking about a website address, it is most accurate to use the term URL.
