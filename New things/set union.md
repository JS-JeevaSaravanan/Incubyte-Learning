JavaScript's `Set` object now has a built-in `union()` method, which makes performing set unions very straightforward. Here's a breakdown:

**Understanding Set Unions**

In mathematics, the union of two sets is a new set that contains all the unique elements from both original sets.

**JavaScript's `Set.prototype.union()`**

- As of recent JavaScript updates, the `Set` prototype includes a `union()` method.
- This method efficiently creates a new `Set` containing all unique elements from the original `Set` and the `Set` passed as an argument.

**Example:**

JavaScript

```
const setA = new Set([1, 2, 3]);
const setB = new Set([3, 4, 5]);

const unionSet = setA.union(setB);

console.log(unionSet); // Output: Set(5) { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }
```

**Key Points:**

- **Uniqueness:** Sets inherently store only unique values. Therefore, the resulting union `Set` will not contain any duplicate elements.
- **Modern Javascript:** This is a relatively new feature, so ensure that you are using a modern browser or Javascript runtime environment that supports it.
- **Alternative (older Javascript):** Before the inclusion of the set.prototype.union() method, the spread operator was commonly used. Example of the older way.
    
    JavaScript
    
    ```
    const setA = new Set([1, 2, 3]);
    const setB = new Set([3, 4, 5]);
    
    const unionSet = new Set([...setA, ...setB]);
    
    console.log(unionSet);
    ```
    

**Benefits of using the built in method:**

- **Readability:** `setA.union(setB)` is very clear and expresses the intent of the code.
- **Efficiency:** Built-in methods are often optimized for performance.

I hope this helps!
