- 00:00:23Medicare-related health care and prescription drug benefits,
- 00:00:26including health plans,
- 00:00:28and many first tier, downstream, and related entities
- 00:00:31provide training in the prevention of fraud, waste, and abuse.
- 00:00:35We are all responsible
- 00:00:37for following applicable FWA laws and regulations.
- 00:00:41When you know the characteristics
- 00:00:42behind fraud, waste, abuse, and error,
- 00:00:46you can help us put an end to the costly practices
- 00:00:48that impact the quality and delivery
- 00:00:50of our health care and our organization.
- 00:00:53You are responsible for knowing the characteristics

# What Is Fraud, Waste, Abuse, and Error?

## Fraud

Fraud occurs when someone intentionally submits false information to any health care benefit program to obtain money or property owned by a health care program. The person knows that their actions are wrong and against the law.

Examples:

- A doctor provides treatment to a member that is not covered by the health care plan, but when they file the claim, they submit the procedure code for a covered treatment.
- An employee steals Social Security numbers to create a fictitious identity on our platform to enter false claims for personal gain.


## Waste

Waste involves practices that are inconsistent with sound fiscal, business, or medical practices and result in inefficiencies or unnecessary costs. Generally, waste is considered to be negligent or careless actions rather than the intentional misuse of resources for criminal acts. The person does not have the intention and knowledge to commit fraud.

Examples:

- A doctor consistently prescribes a high-cost medication rather than using the generic drug (of which they are not aware).
- An administrator sends paper documents rather than using electronic transfers, causing unnecessary copying, sorting, and handling of the documents.


## Abuse

Abuse occurs when someone provides information which leads to the improper use of resources for personal or business gain, without sufficient evidence to prove criminal intent.

It is difficult to differentiate between abuse and fraud because the distinction depends on specific facts and circumstances, intent and prior knowledge, available evidence, and other factors.

Examples:

- A doctor provides a treatment that is not medically necessary and files a claim for payment.
- An employee uses work email to ask for donations to an organization where she volunteers.


## Error

Error occurs when someone unintentionally provides inaccurate information. Errors are often considered “honest mistakes” but are still a cause of cost overruns and are to be avoided.

Examples:

- A doctor provides a treatment that is not covered and unintentionally transposes the code for a treatment that is covered.
- An employee accidentally enters the wrong dollar amount for a submitted claim.
- A system bug occurs that prevents statements from going out properly.



- 00:00:00Fraud, waste, and abuse cause a wide range of problems,
- 00:00:03including loss of confidence in health care programs,
- 00:00:07forcing increased government regulation and controls,
- 00:00:11higher costs for those providing benefits,
- 00:00:14higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs for consumers,
- 00:00:18reduced benefits for consumers,
- 00:00:20depletion of the Medicare Trust Fund
- 00:00:23and increased taxes for all,
- 00:00:25and lost revenues for our organization.
- 00:00:28As you can see, there are a wide range of reasons for all of us
- 00:00:32to protect against fraud, waste, and abuse.
- 00:00:35One of the most important things you can do
- 00:00:37is to keep an eye out for any activity
- 00:00:39that may indicate fraud, waste, or abuse.
- 00:00:42While there are countless and ever-changing different types of FWA,
- 00:00:46you can learn to recognize some of the warning signs
- 00:00:49by understanding the patterns or practices
- 00:00:52for different types of abusers in the health care system.
- 00:00:56Take a moment to learn more about how to identify
- 00:00:59common signs of fraud, waste, and abuse.

- 00:00:00All personnel, employees, contractors, and vendors
- 00:00:03working in health care must adhere to the specific laws
- 00:00:06that relate to fraud, waste, and abuse.
- 00:00:09While you are not responsible
- 00:00:11for knowing the "letter of the law,"
- 00:00:13you should be familiar with the relevant laws
- 00:00:15with which we must comply.
- 00:00:18Take a moment to learn more about each of the relevant laws.


# Relevant Laws of Fraud, Waste, and Abuse


## False Claims Act

The False Claims Act prohibits:

- Presenting a false claim for payment or approval
- Making or using a false record or statement in support of a false claim
- Conspiring to violate the False Claims Act
- Falsely certifying the type or amount of property to be used by the government
- Certifying receipt of property without knowing if it’s true
- Buying property from an unauthorized government officer
- Knowingly concealing and/or improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay the government


## Fraud Enforcement Recovery Act (FERA)

Signed into law on May 20, 2009, FERA was created to eliminate FWA. It expands liability to indirect recipients of federal funds and significantly enhances the government’s ability to fight fraud through the amendments to the False Claims Act.


## Anti-Kickback Statute

The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying money (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate) for service referrals that are paid in whole or in part under a federal health care program. This includes the Medicare program.



## Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)

As an individual who has access to protected health care information, you are responsible for adhering to HIPAA and HITECH law.

The 1996 HIPAA regulations created:

- Protections for the privacy and security of health care data
- Safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to protected health care information
- Additional protections for electronic health care records

The HITECH Act of 2009 includes some significant changes to the HIPAA standard regarding the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI) and also contains new notification requirements in the event of a breach of unsecured PHI.

The HITECH Act also increases the consequences of inappropriate disclosure of protected information by raising the fines for non-compliance and granting State Attorney Generals the authority to enforce HIPAA.

You are individually responsible — and accountable — for recognizing how HIPAA and HITECH requirements apply to your job function.



- 00:00:00Everyone is responsible for stopping fraud, waste, and abuse.
- 00:00:04A confirmed violation of related laws
- 00:00:06could result in consequences ranging from internal actions
- 00:00:09to civil and criminal penalties.
- 00:00:12Such violations can compromise our integrity and reputation,
- 00:00:16and destroy the trust of those we work with.
- 00:00:19Internal consequences may include
- 00:00:21oral or written warnings or reprimands,
- 00:00:24termination of employment or contract,
- 00:00:26mandatory retraining, and corrective measures.
- 00:00:31When required, we must report any violation
- 00:00:33to the appropriate external organization.
- 00:00:36For example, Medicare fraud must be reported to CMS,
- 00:00:40a CMS designee, and law enforcement agencies.
- 00:00:44Take a moment to learn more about the civil and criminal penalties
- 00:00:48for fraud, waste, and abuse violations.



# Penalties of Fraud, Waste, and Abuse

## False Claims Act

- Violators may face civil penalties of $13,946 to $27,894 per claim.
- Damages can be three times the amount of the government's damages.
- If a prison term is imposed, it can be for any length of time, depending on the severity of the offense. If the fraud results in bodily injury or death, then the term may increase to life imprisonment.



## HIPAA and HITECH ACT
