#### Social Enginnering In Action:

• Social engineering is the art of manipulating
people, not computers.
• These attacks utilize a variety of mediums
including email, text messages, and
phone calls.
• Never reveal confidential information unless
you can confirm the recipient is legitimate.


#### Phishing:

• Scammers craft emails that impersonate real
websites or apps.
• Hasty clicks are dangerous clicks.
• Slow down and thoroughly inspect emails
before taking any action.


#### Clicks:
• Treat requests for sensitive information with
skepticism.
• Stay alert for typical red flags like bad grammar
and urgent or threatening language.
• Report all phishing attacks immediately.



####  Strong password

Passwords represent a fundamental part of security awareness. Your login credentials are all that stand between your personal information and cybercriminals. Protect your accounts by creating strong passwords that feature these seven characteristics.

1) Length : Length equals strength! Ideally, a password should include at least 16 unrepeated characters.
2) Complexity : While it’s true that complex passwords are difficult to crack, they’re also difficult to remember. Avoid complicating your passwords with random symbols, numbers, and letters unless required.
3) PassPrases : A passphrase is a string of words that makes sense to you, such as a quote from your favorite book or movie. Passphrases are easy to remember, hard to guess, and satisfy length requirements.
4) Uniqueness: Every account and device should have a unique password. Otherwise, if your credentials get stolen, someone could use them to gain access to multiple accounts.
5) Password Managers: A password manager is software that can create, store, and sync your login credentials. Ask about using one here at work, and utilize one in your personal life.
6) MFA: Multi-factor authentication, or MFA, provides additional layers of security by requiring you to enter a secondary code before accessing an account.
7) Policy: Following our organization's current password policies is one of your top responsibilities. We also encourage you to apply these password recommendations to your personal life, and create your own policies that help ensure your accounts don’t fall into the hands of scammers.


#### Mobile devices and remote securiy

• Always use a virtual private network while connected to public WiFi.
• Stay alert for phishing attacks that target you via text message.
• Keep devices and software up to date and allow automatic updates when possible.


#### Physical Security:

• Never plug in random USB flash drives or cables.
• Lock your workstation When not in use.
• Shred sensitive documents when they're no longer needed.


#### Working from home:

• Organizational policies must be followed at all\ times, even while working remotely.
• Keep work and personal accounts separate.
• Don't allow other members of your household to access work-related information.




### Social Media Awareness


For all the benefits that social media provides, it also presents a network of security issues and other concerns. Let’s take a look at a few of these concerns and uncover what you can do to stay secure.

#### Disinformation

Disinformation is false or misleading information that is deliberately created and intentionally spread to obscure the truth and influence public opinion.

#### Misinformation

Like disinformation, misinformation is also misleading, but often spread without sinister intentions. Both are dangerous. Conspiracy theories, for example, can easily destroy relationships or result in violence.

#### Data Mining

Social media is often used by scammers to research their targets and gather information from public profiles. The more personal information they can find, the more convincing they can make themselves seem to the eventual victim.


#### Fake Profiles

Criminals can create fake profiles impersonating someone you know, hoping you’ll connect with them. If successful, they will gain access to everything you post and send additional friend requests to your contacts with the intent of stealing personal information or sending requests for money.

#### Phishing Attacks

A person abruptly clicked on a LinkedIn invite thinking it was a new connection. Cybercriminals often send malicious messages disguised as friend requests, knowing that a lot of people have a strong desire to build their follower or friend count.


### How to Stay Safe on Social Media

- Set your profiles to private and vet anyone who sends you a friend request.
- Limit the amount of information you share, even if your profile is set to private.
- Never post confidential information or anything that could be used against you or our organization.
- Consider that anything you share now could impact your job or future promotions.
- Use extreme caution when spreading information that could be deemed offensive or potentially false.

Note : Many joke that the internet is forever, and it’s best to operate as though it's the truth. Stay alert and share with care!


### Incident Response:
• Security incidents can be anything from
phishing attacks to random USB devices.
• Report security incidents immediately.
• The longer an incident goes unreported, the
more damage it can cause.


### Recap:

Phishing remains a massive threat.
A simple careless click could compromise all of our hard work. Think
before you click, thoroughly review messages before taking an action,
and stay alert for common red flags.

Social engineering demonstrates that security is a people problem, not
always a technology problem.
Social engineers prey on human emotions and leverage them to
convince people to make poor decisions. Always treat requests for
confidential information or money with skepticism.


Password hygiene is vital to securing accounts.
A weak or reused password provides an opportunity for attackers to
easily gain control of accounts. Remember, longer is stronger, and
passwords should never be duplicated or shared.


Mobile devices deserve the same level of awareness as traditional
computers.
Keep smart devices up to date, scrutinize apps before installing, and
use a virtual private network (VPN) when connecting to public WiFi.
Don't underestimate the risks the computer in your pocket presents.


Physical security is just as important as cybersecurity.
It's also one of the most simple forms of security. Locking
workstations, shredding documents, and ensuring doors are locked
and no one slips in behind you are just a few examples of physical
security.



Social media poses a legitimate threat.
From disinformation to phishing attacks, social media must be
regarded as a powerful weapon for scammers. Set your accounts to
private, think critically before sharing, and vet all friend requests.



Working from home comes with great responsibility.
No matter where you work, organizational policies still apply. It's your
responsibility to ensure your home network is secure and that your
work and personal accounts remain separate.


The importance of incident response and following policy cannot be
overstated.
The longer an incident of any manner goes unreported, the more
damage it can cause. Remember, our policies exist to help protect the
privacy of employees, clients, customers, and business associates.
