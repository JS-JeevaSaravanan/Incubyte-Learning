It's important to understand that "undefined" as a value has specific meaning within JavaScript, but it's not a standard data type recognized by JSON, which is what most APIs use for data exchange. Therefore, you can't directly send "undefined" in a Postman API request in the way you might intend.

Here's a breakdown of the situation and how to handle it:

**Understanding the Issue:**

- **JSON Limitations:**
    - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) supports data types like strings, numbers, booleans, null, objects, and arrays.
    - "undefined" is a JavaScript-specific concept, not a JSON one.
- **API Expectations:**
    - Most APIs expect valid JSON. Sending "undefined" will likely result in a parsing error or an unexpected behavior.

**How to Handle "Undefined" Scenarios in Postman:**

1. **Use `null`:**
    
    - The closest equivalent to "undefined" in JSON is `null`.
    - If you want to represent the absence of a value, send `null` in your request body.
    - Example:
        
        JSON
        
        ```
        {
          "myValue": null
        }
        ```
        
2. **Omit the Key:**
    
    - In many cases, if a value is "undefined," it means it's not present.
    - Instead of sending a key with a `null` value, you can simply omit the key from the JSON object.
    - Example:
        
        JSON
        
        ```
        {
          "otherValue": "someData"
        }
        ```
        
        In this case "myValue" is just not present.
3. **String Representation (Less Ideal):**
    
    - As a last resort, if the API specifically requires a string representation, you could send `"undefined"` as a string.
    - However, this is generally not recommended as it can lead to confusion and inconsistencies.
    - example:
        
        JSON
        
        ```
        {
            "myValue": "undefined"
        }
        ```
        
    - This way the recieving api will recive the string "undefined", and not the javascript keyword.

**Key Takeaway:**

- Focus on using `null` or omitting the key when you want to represent the absence of a value in your API requests.
- Always check the target API's documentation to see how it handles missing or null values.
