sharing base64 in url is fine ?


Sharing Base64 encoded data within URLs can be done, but it comes with several important considerations:

**Here's a breakdown:**

- **URL Length Limitations:**
    - URLs have length limits, which vary depending on the browser and server.1 Base64 strings, especially for larger data (like images), can be very long.2 This can lead to truncated URLs and data loss.
- **URL Encoding:**
    - Standard Base64 encoding uses characters like "+" and "/", which have special meanings in URLs. To avoid issues, you should use Base64 URL encoding, which replaces these characters with "-" and3 "_".
- **Security Concerns:**
    - Base64 encoding is not encryption.4 The data is simply encoded, not secured.5 Anyone with the URL can decode the Base64 string and access the original data. If you're dealing with sensitive information, this is a significant risk.
    - Also, URLs are very often logged by many different servers and systems, so sensitive information inside of a URL is very exposed.
- **Performance:**
    - Very long URLs can impact performance, both for the client and the server.
- **Use Cases:**
    - Embedding small images or data directly into HTML or CSS using data URIs (which include Base64) is a common use case.6
    - Passing small amounts of data in URL parameters can also be done, but it should be used cautiously.

**In summary:**

- It's technically possible, but it's not always the best practice.
- Be mindful of URL length limits and use Base64 URL encoding.
- Avoid using it for sensitive data.
- Consider if other methods of transfering the data would be more appropriate.

Therefore, while "fine" in the sense that it can function, it is not "fine" in the sense of being best practice for many situations.
