Questions to ask:

- Can this ticket move to the next planned state?
- If no what is the ETA?
- Is there any blocker to move this ticket to the next state?
- Are there any on-call tasks such as bugs or to do’s that are being worked upon. If yes, do we need a ticket for the same?

  

Note:

1. If there are any discussions that require more time and people, put that in parking lot.
2. When a parking lot topic is picked up and if you are aware of the time it takes, do ask whether everyone is needed for that discussion?
3. If a topic or discussion is not relevant to others or is taking more time than expected then say “Jellyfish”
