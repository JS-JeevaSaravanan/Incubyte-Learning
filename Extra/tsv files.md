A TSV (tab-separated values) file is ==a plain text file that stores data in a table structure==. Each line in the file represents a record in the table, and each field in the record is separated by a tab. 

Features 

- TSV files are a popular way to exchange data between programs that use spreadsheets or structured tables.
- TSV files are similar to CSV (comma-separated values) files, but TSV uses tabs instead of commas to separate fields.

- TSV files can store a variety of data, including text, numbers, statistical, scientific, or mathematical data.

- The first line of a TSV file usually contains the name of each field, separated by tabs.

- Each record in a TSV file must have the same number of fields.

How to open TSV files

- You can open TSV files with most spreadsheet programs, such as Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice, or OpenOffice. 

- You can also open TSV files with text editors like Notepad or TextEdit. 

- You can open TSV files online using Tab Lab. 

Alternatives to TSV
