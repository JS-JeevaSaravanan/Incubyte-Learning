In TypeScript, both interfaces and classes are fundamental building blocks for defining the structure and behavior of your code, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Here's a breakdown of their key differences:

**Interfaces:**

- **Purpose:** Define a contract for the shape of an object. They specify the properties and methods that an object must have, but they don't provide any implementation details.
- **Implementation:** Interfaces cannot be instantiated. They are purely for type checking and ensuring that objects conform to a specific structure.
- **Members:** Can only contain properties and method signatures (declarations without implementations).
- **Inheritance:** Can inherit from multiple interfaces.
- **Example:**

TypeScript

```
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  getProfile(): string;
}
```

**Classes:**

- **Purpose:** Define a blueprint for creating objects. They encapsulate data (properties) and behavior (methods) and provide implementation details.
- **Implementation:** Classes can be instantiated using the `new` keyword to create objects.
- **Members:** Can contain properties, methods (with implementations), constructors, and static members.
- **Inheritance:** Can inherit from a single class and implement multiple interfaces.
- **Example:**

TypeScript

```
class User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;

  constructor(id: number, name: string, email: string) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.email = email;
  }

  getProfile(): string {
    return `ID: ${this.id}, Name: ${this.name}, Email: ${this.email}`;
  }
}
```

**Key Differences Summarized:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Feature**|**Interface**|**Class**|
|Purpose|Contract|Blueprint|
|Instantiation|Not possible|Possible|
|Implementation|No|Yes|
|Members|Properties, method signatures|Properties, methods, constructors, static members|
|Inheritance|Multiple interfaces|Single class, multiple interfaces|

**When to Use Which:**

- **Interfaces:**
    - Defining the shape of data.
    - Enforcing contracts between different parts of your code.
    - Creating reusable types.
    - Achieving polymorphism (objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common interface).
- **Classes:**
    - Creating objects with state and behavior.
    - Encapsulating data and logic.
    - Implementing inheritance and polymorphism.
    - Building complex applications with reusable components.

In many cases, you'll use both interfaces and classes together. For example, you might define an interface to specify the contract for a certain type of object, and then create a class that implements that interface. This combination provides both type safety and code reusability.
